Meeting summaries:

meeting_20210622.Rmd
- Outline read_write.R utility functions for reading in detected communities,
  BOCC results, and the graph. 
- Discuss multiedges and why they exist. 
    Ans: They were in there by mistake. String listed every edge twice.
- Discuss self loops, and why they exist. 
    Ans: They were in there by mistake. They were removed.

- Explore possible weighting scheme for the graph. Currently, every edge is
  associated with a disease. Some links only pertain to one disease whereas others
  pertain to many diseases. We are collaposing over the number of diseases and 
  treating all edges the same. What if we weighted by the number of diseases 
  associated with each edge? 
    Ans: Do this and compare the communities generated by walktrap. Results for
    next week's meeting.
- Explore the difference in the phenotype_to_gene and gene_to_phenotype files in
  the human phenotype ontology. We are only considering the gene_to_phenotype. Why?
    Ans: Turns out that gene_to_phenotype links are a strict subset of the
    phenotype_to_genes link. The extra edges pertain to HPO linking genes to ancenstors
    up the HPO tree, which we likely are not interested in.
- Find an example where pruning can substantially change the identified communities.

meeting_20210727.Rmd
- Try to pin down the effects of community discovery with a weighted graph, using Walktrap as an example.
